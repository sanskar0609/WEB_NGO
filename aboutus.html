      <b><i><p>SATTVIC FOOD</p></i></b>
<p>All fresh foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, edible greens, grains, sprouts, legumes, nuts are considered as Sattvic food. Along with nourishing the body, this type of light and healthy food helps to maintain a balance between the body, mind, and spirit. Sattvic food enhances our alertness, energy, and consciousness, resulting in peaceful and harmonious life.</p>

      <b><i><p>RAJASIC FOOD</p></b></i>
      <p>
This type of food has a stimulating and habit-forming effect on the mind and body such as spicy, salty, and sour foods including egg, fish, meat, caffeinated drinks and the like. This type of food stimulates the nervous system and speeds up metabolism, but creates an imbalanced energy leading to engagement in worldly activities and sensual pleasure.</p>

      <b><i><p>TAMASIC FOOD</p></i></b>
<p>This type of food is generally overcooked, re-cooked and processed including alcohol and drugs. They have no life-force left in them and nourish only the grossest aspects of the body. Tamasic food results in weight gain, diseases, lethargy, irritability, and promotes negative emotions. It also contributes to degeneration of the moral fabric of the society.</p>
